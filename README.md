# Aircraft Performance Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for simulating the gliding performance of an aircraft. The simulation models the aircraft's flight dynamics, aerodynamics, and environmental conditions.

## Features
* **Aerodynamic modeling:** Calculates lift, drag, and other aerodynamic forces.
* **Flight dynamics:** Simulates the aircraft's motion using a system of differential equations.
* **Atmospheric modeling:** Implements the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model.
* **Control system:** Includes basic flight control logic for gliding.
* **Simulation:** Numerically integrates the equations of motion to simulate the flight.

## Getting Started
